# Customer-Personality-Analysis


PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It
helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to
modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different
types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target
customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending
money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a
company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then
market the product only on that particular segment.

OBJECTIVE:

The main objective here is -
1. What people say about your product: what gives customers’ attitude towards the
product.
2. What people do: which reveals what people are doing rather than what they are
saying about your product.
